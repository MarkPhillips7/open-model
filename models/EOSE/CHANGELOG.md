# Spreadsheet changelog

The live model is the Google Sheet **[EOSE Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mkceZ4pgKhCAsWszlUVzk0RoHGeRRORfWIX9lB7Ejek/edit?usp=sharing)** (ticker **EOSE**). Git does not see those edits unless they are recorded here. Repo/platform changes go in the [root CHANGELOG](../../CHANGELOG.md).

**After every agent write to the sheet, append an entry below before finishing.** One dated heading per change-set.

Entry template:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title

- **Tab / range:** what changed
- **Insert/delete:** dimension, start index, count
- **Formulas:** before → after (a template is enough if copied across columns)
- **Data:** cells and values, plus why
- **Side effects:** charts, notes, number formats
```
